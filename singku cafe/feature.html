    <h2>Our Coffees</h2>
    <p>
      At Singku Cafe, every cup of coffee is crafted to be more than just a drink — it’s an experience. 
      We take pride in sourcing quality beans that bring out rich, smooth, and comforting flavors, whether 
      you’re craving something bold and straightforward like an Americano, sweet and creamy like our signature 
      Iced Spanish Latte, or indulgent with a touch of chocolate or caramel. From hot brews that warm your mornings 
      to iced creations that refresh your afternoons, our coffees are made to match your mood and moments. 
      At Singku, we believe coffee is not only about taste but also about creating little pauses in life where 
      you can slow down, breathe, and enjoy.
